# 📊 PrimeStream RFM Analysis (Excel + Tableau Project)

This project focuses on conducting an **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** for PrimeStream, a rapidly growing video streaming platform. The analysis was performed in **Excel**, and the insights were visualized in an **interactive Tableau dashboard** for better storytelling and decision-making.

## 🔹 Problem Statement
PrimeStream has observed fluctuations in user engagement since the onboarding of new customers in December 2024. To enhance retention and optimize customer experience, the company provided user interaction data (visit and watch time) for December 2024.  

The task is to perform a detailed **RFM analysis** to segment customers based on engagement levels and recommend personalized strategies as of **1st January 2025**.

- Analyze behavioral patterns and identify key user groups.  
- Recommend **personalized engagement strategies** to improve retention.  
- Build a **Tableau dashboard** for interactive exploration of RFM results.
